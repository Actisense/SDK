# SDK Documents

This is the main documentation repository for the SDK. It contains comprehensive resources including:

- **Technical Documentation** – Data formats, communication protocols, and API references
- **User Manuals** – Step-by-step guides for installation, configuration, and usage
- **Developer Resources** – Code examples, best practices, and integration guides
- **Reference Materials** – Specifications, standards compliance, and technical definitions

## Data Formats and Protocols

### Overview

**Data Formats** define the structure and encoding of information - how data is organized, represented, and stored. They specify the layout, field types, byte order, and encoding schemes used to represent meaningful information in a standardized way.

**Data Protocols** define the rules and procedures for communication - how data is exchanged between systems. They specify message sequences, timing requirements, error handling, and the behavior needed for reliable transmission and reception of data.

In essence: **formats** describe *what* the data looks like, while **protocols** describe *how* to exchange it.
